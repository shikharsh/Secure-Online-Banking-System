# Secure-Online-Banking-System
This is my project on a replica of an Online Banking System in C following all the CERT guidelines and recommendations. This was a part of the course 'Secured Programming with C'. 
This project deals with buffer errors, invalid inputs and most of the kind of attacks that can cause a program to crash and at the same time makes it readable.

To run this project you need the GCC compiler installed in your system with the necessary libraries mentioned in the 'headers.h' file.

To run type these commands in your Command prompt/terminal:

1> gcc PROJ_main.c functions.c -o bank
2> ./bank.exe
